# Data-Transformation-Using-PowerQuery-And-Rscript


## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for our project aimed at transforming unstructured data files into structured formats to facilitate uploading into SAP. This project aims to automate the conversion process, significantly reducing the time required for this task.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to streamline the transformation of unstructured data into structured formats suitable for uploading into SAP. By automating this process, we aim to minimize manual intervention and save valuable time for our team.

## Technologies Used
- Power Query
- R Script

## Why Power Query and R Script?
Initially, we explored various tools for transforming unstructured data into structured formats. However, we encountered limitations with these tools, particularly in handling the complexity and variability of our data. As a result, we turned to Power Query and R Script for their flexibility and robustness in data manipulation tasks.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather unstructured data files from various sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: Utilize Power Query and R Script to convert unstructured data into structured formats.
3. **Validation**: Verify the accuracy and completeness of the transformed data.
4. **Integration with SAP**: Upload the structured data into SAP for further processing.

## Benefits
- **Time Efficiency**: By automating the transformation process, we can complete the task in just one minute, saving significant time compared to manual methods.
- **Accuracy**: The use of Power Query and R Script ensures accurate transformation, reducing the risk of errors in the structured data.
